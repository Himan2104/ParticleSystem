# ParticleSystem
A particle system simulator for research and optimizations (and fun!).


Made using C++/SFML.


This is a very barebones simulation so be wary of what you're playing with.
It was made just for study and possible implementation is games by 
modifying how the optimizations are handled based on the needs of the user.
**NOT** suggested to be used for *very important stuff*.


Feel free to play around with it, fork it, modify it and maybe break it.

Also, if you are looking to contribute or discuss anything related to simulations

Thank You for your time! :)
